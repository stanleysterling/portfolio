                    <p>I hate masks.</p>
                    <p>The masks I'm mentioning here aren't the masks that individuals put on to protect themselves from exposing who they truly are â€“ I mean the "masks" that protect us from COVID-19.</p>
                    <p>Wearing a mask, I can't breathe properly, I sweat all over my face in summer days, I smell what I just ate, I have to take it off to unlock my phone, I have to talk a bit louder to make sure people hear me talking to them.</p>
                    <p>I really hate masks, but under certain circumstances, it matters life or death.</p>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>We were taught to wear masks whenever it is needed. We have to wear a mask when we catch a cold or had a flu. We better wear masks in public places, especially indoors or public transportations, when there's an enterovirus epidemic. We were taught that masks are safeguards that not only prevent us from spreading the bacteria and viruses around, but also ensure that we won't be infected by others.</p>
                    <p>In 2009, the outbreak of the Swine Flu (H1N1) pandemic impacted the world. I was only 6 years old, a little kid who just graduated from kindergarten and had started elementary school for only a few weeks. I remembered the teachers asked us to always have our face masks on, make sure our hands are disinfected constantly. I really wanted to resist the discomfort of wearing a mask, the large sheet of mask is covering my tiny face, and hanging items onto my face is really uncomfortable. In fact, I didn't even understand why were we wearing masks.</p>
                    <p>I remember there was a really hot day, and we were having a class in a basement. I felt something wet on my face. Initially, I thought sweating was reasonable under such circumstances, so I decided to ignore it. But later when I tried to wipe the sweat drops off my face, I pulled down my mask and swept my right sleeve across my face, I saw red, the kind of red you see in car accidents. Great, I thought. I was nose bleeding and I didn't know, now it's all over my face and my clothes.</p>
                    <p>One usual night at home, just like the other days, I was packing up my bag preparing for school next day. My parents received a phone call from the school, telling them that school will be closed for a week. I had no idea but sort of terrified. Apparently, almost half a dozen of my classmates were tested positive of the swine flu, so the school had to be closed immediately to avoid further infection and also to execute a total disinfection. By that time I finally know the seriousness and importance of a mask, though I still hate it, I know that I had to put it on firmly, both for my own safety and the public hygiene and sanitation.</p>

                    <p>I would never have thought of this day to come, and I will never believe that I have actually done this, but I have been wearing masks for more than 8 months, consecutively, and it is very likely to get longer. It is the year 2020. Something similar to the global pandemic in 2009 has happened again, only that it's way more severe and destructive. COVID-19 no doubt has influenced every single individual in this world in 2020. Borders are closed, cities and towns are under lockdown, activities out of the houses are prohibited, intense curfews are executed, business go bankrupt, people get unemployed, the loved ones are tested positive of the coronavirus, some lived but some family members and friends die because of coronavirus, those heartbreaking farewells and so many other chaos going on. I still feel like the reality now looks just like a science fiction movie. It feels so unreal, but it is actually happening around us, in daily life.</p>
                    <p>Masks are proven to be effective to prevent the spread of the viruses. It significantly decreases the spatter range or radius when you cough or sneeze. It filtrates the contaminated air when you cough or people around you cough. It not only prevents spreading, but also protects ourselves from getting infected. Taiwan is a role model for the experiment of the effectiveness of masks. In the early times of the outbreak, the general public is terrified of COVID-19, and literally everyone you see in public places or on streets wears a mask, even if it is right in the middle of the summer. The coronavirus might have really intruded Taiwan, but the prudence of Taiwanese people successfully broke the spreading chain by wearing masks and make this place safer than ever, safer than anywhere on Earth, even if the epicenter is right next to us.</p>
                    <p>Though masks are already proven to be essential in "flattening the line" by the World Health Organization, there are always those men who refuse to wear masks. They insist that it's their liberty to decide whether they want to wear it or not, and it is also their freedom to breather "normally". Some even believe that the effects of the masks are fake, masks are only the money-making tools of the enterprises.</p>
                    <p>A YouTube video witnessed an experiment conducted by two teenagers. They observed that people joggin or tanning or just spending time on the beach never wear masks, so they brought a box of mask to the beach, trying to distribute those masks to those who are not wearing for free. But when they give out the masks, people instead ask them why they should wear masks. People told the two teenagers to get out of their ways and even cursed them. As a person who had a horrifying experience and knows the importance of masks. How could they be so ignorant and slefish? This matters life or death!</p>
                    <p>Earlier this year before the global outbreak, my family and I were traveling in the Netherlands. We saw the news in Asia that the virus was spreading, and we soon determined that it is definetely going to become a lot worse (the situation right now is far worse than we expected). We went hunting for masks in local pharmacy shops, assuming that the Dutch didn't know about the pandemic yet. Astonishingly, none of them sell masks. We asked the clerks and they looked so confused. They told is that masks only appear in hospitals and we should look for masks there. It is very terrifying to see how Europeans contempt the importances of masks.</p>
                    <p>After witnessing how the Westerners treat the isue of masks, it's not difficult to understand how the pandemic ends up like this, which is certainly going to get worse. The sense of individuality in the Western culture brings up the consequence of people only pay attention to themselves instead of concerning the situation as a whole. People influenced by Oriental culture, however, not only focus on oursleves, but also concern about others to a certain extent. Although wearing masks might be uncomfortable for ourselves, for an individual, we still wear it when we don't feel right just to make sure others won't get infected by us. The sense of caring and empathy is what those Westerners lack. With less selfishness and more caring about the others, disregarding the extent, the societies can definetely become better.</p>
