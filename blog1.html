                    <p>This morning is another toilful day. I had to "bring" my bike to school. It's a scorching day, and moving this heavy bike around is nowhere easy especially in such days. <b>I hate sweating</b>. There are only two days left until I need to use it, so I have to figure out a way to bring my bike to school.</p>
                    <p>As you might intuitively imagine, there are several ways to bring it to school; carry it, or ride it directly to school! Yes, it's that <i>easy</i>, but, plot twist: my home is 110 kilometers away from school. Yes, it's that <i>easy</i>.</p>
                    <p>First of all, I will disassemble my bike into several parts and pack them into a bicycle bag and finally load them onto my dad's car the night before. Next morning, my dad will drive me to the High Speed Rail Station and that's where the pain starts. I have to carry the disassembled-bike-in-a-bag on my shoulder all the way to the platform and then board the train. The single strap tied on the bike that lies on my shoulder feels just like high school homework, exerting pressure on my poor skeleton.</p>

                    <p>After I arrived in Hsinchu, I will have several choices to decide how to get my bike to school, it's either get the bag onto a taxi or assemble it immediately and ride it to school. Normally I will choose the second option because it is always faster. I can avoid traffic easily and maybe sometimes run some red lights.  But every single time when I step out of the station, the border of air conditioning and heat, I walk straight directly to the taxis, I don't are about my purse anymore, the sun is extorting my soul.</p>
                    <p>There is actually another easier way to move my bike to school. way easier. That is, directly ride it to school form home. I've done it once, but I'm pretty sure that I will never do it again. technically, I rode the bike from school back home. You don't need much preparation and carrying, you just need time. If I want to be on time for school, I will have to leave home as soon as I have finished homework so that I can arrive in the next morning. Sounds practical?</p>
                    <p>Anyways. After the taxi brings me and my bike to school, I have to assemble them back into shape and place it into our bike shed. It only takes about ten minutes.</p>
                    <p>Damn it. No matter which method I choose, I always sweat like I've peed myself.</p>
