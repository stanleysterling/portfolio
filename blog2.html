                    <p>Walking on the streets in downtown Amsterdam, there's always this smell in which you will imagine it's a combustion of some kind of a medical herb, only that it is so unique and pungent, many people refer it to as a smell of a "skunk". In those street-side coffeeshops, joints (cannabis cigarettes) and "space cakes (sweet baked cakes with cannabis butter in them)" and all these whimsical named products are sold to the public legally. To the locals, this might feel as usual as daily life. No matter their age, residents stop by and spend their cozy weekend afternoons in the coffeeshops all the time, while some foreign tourists might find it novel and appealing. People use cannabis to relief stress or reduce pain, similar to the usage of alcohol or those normal cigarettes, and cannabis sometimes can even replace alcohol and cigarettes.</p>
                    <p>Most countries still consider cannabis as a drug and believe that it increases crime rates and even become the "gateway" into more severe drug usages. Though these being said, the Netherlands had shown us the effect of the legalization of cannabis, which seems nothing needed to be concerned of. Or are there actually hidden disadvantages? Should cannabis be legalized since it seems being less harmful? Or should cannabis be restricted or prohibited because there might still contain potential risks of increasing social costs?</p>
                    <p>To date, debate about the legitimacy of the cannabis is still undergoing. Scientists bring up their research data from those places where cannabis is legalized and deduce how cannabis can affect the societies. Some research from the United States found out that crime rates decreases when marijuana is legalized. The data from this research indicates that people drink less and alcohol sales drop. The amount of crime and violence caused by alcohol use is ten times higher than by marijuana use and alcohol is a factor in around 40% of violent crimes. Taylor West, former deputy for the National Cannabis Industry Association, said,</p>
                    <h2>"We're not seeing any increase in crime rates through marijuana â€“ we're seeing lower crime rates, and there are good rationals for that: We're really beginning to cripple the criminal market, which is where violence actually occurs."</h2>
                    <p>However, there's always a dark side behind anything. Marijuana abuse harms the brain, and legalization will increase mental health problems. Cannabis use may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. Researchers at Harvard and Northwestern found that recreational marijuana smokers showed abnormalities in the shape, volume, and density of certain areas of the brain. Dr. Hans Breiter, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital who co-authored the study, said,</p>
                    <h2>"People think a little marijuana shouldn't cause a problem if someone is doing O.K. with work or school. Our data directly says this is not so."</h2>
                    <p>A survey published in <i>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</i> journal reported that 22% of marijuana users experienced "acute anxiety or panic attacks following cannabis use," and 15% had psychotic symptoms following use.</p>
                    <p>When you might think Amsterdam can become the city of sins, you should be aware that there are still certain regulations on cannabis use. For instance, if an individual is caught in possession of up to five grams of cannabis, the authorities will most likely confiscate the weed. The individual can even be fined or sent to prison if the if the authorities consider that the cannabis use was a threat to the health of young people. Marijuana is neither allowed in public. Given the fact that cannabis use has been decriminalized and the possession of small quantities of cannabis is tolerated, the Dutch authorities do not actively pursue these matters. But smoking in public can still get you a warning or a fine as a consequence.</p>
                    <p>A music festival was held in Rotterdam in 1970. Thousands of youths smoked cannabis unmolested, while policemen in civilian clothes walked around observing them. Cees Ottevanger, then a young police inspector, told Dutch TV program Andere Tijden decades later:</p>
                    <h2>"With all the will in the world, we couldn't report that it was bad or awful or unpleasant. Because it was fantastic, the atmosphere, and there was no reason to fear that anything would happen."</h2>
                    <p>People still hold certain imaginations of the fanciness of cannabis. While demands of legalizing cannabis eventually rise, the governments should still prudently consider all the effects and consequences before actually bringing cannabis into the countries. There are no certain corrects or incorrects on how this issue should be treated. Cautiously take the local cultures and societies into account and wisely make a decision that brings the most positive effects to the country or mainstream public opinion is what a government should do now to find out the best solution to this issue.</p>
