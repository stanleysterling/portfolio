                        <h1>Significance Essay</h1>

                    <div id="body">
                        <p>When I got to school that day, I remember waving at my friend, though he didn’t see me so I did the quick high-five-to-comb-over technique. Walking through the doors into school, what do you know, someone left a banana on the ground and I slipped and fell. Everyone laughed.  And in our class speech, I approached the front of the room (unknowingly with my fly unzipped, of course) and I probably gave the worst presentation that morning.</p>
                        <p>Do you ever have one of those days?</p>
                        <p>Yeah, me neither.</p>
                        <p>But I <i>felt</i> this way. Every day. These physical manifestations of embarrassment and the feeling of not belonging is something I’ve learned to live with. I was an average, anti-social kid; I loved being alone and living in my own world. Seeing my classmates running around the playground, or watching them play a passionate game on the football field, I stood on the side quietly, always feeling afraid. I was terrified of joining them and meeting those people who had different personalities and thoughts than me. I was terrified that they would think that I’m not “cool”. I felt embarrassed.</p>
                        <p>Piece by piece, I lost confidence in meeting new people. I felt most safe alone, with my own thoughts. I mean, I’m never going to get hurt when making friends with myself, right? I was trapped in this mindset. In this comfort zone.</p>
                        <p>I was wandering around school, when I walked past a classroom with people who looked clever. They were calm, they were tinkering, and they were having fun. Some were using wrenches and screwdrivers, some were coding, others were holding onto remote controllers.  And then, something just clicked. I don’t know why, nor what motivated me to enter that room, as if it was an out-of-body experience. I was on auto-pilot, but I knew that this is where I should belong. I signed up to be a part of the VEX team.</p>
                        <p>I started to tinker. Watching my machine develop was exhilarating; I had never been so eager to see my ideas come alive. We worked and worked, staying late after school, trying to figure out the perfect coding in order to make our robot behave to what we wanted. Coding became my favorite part of the process, as it allowed me to get outside my own head and to think about how to create.</p>
                        <p>I didn’t feel embarrassed at all. I felt a part of something.</p>
                        <p>As my skills developed, there were bigger projects waiting for me, and with increasing complexity, it became more strenuous and eventually impossible for a single person to complete. I needed to trust in people again; I needed my team. They taught me how to construct the robot. I taught them how to design the circuit board. They helped me build. I helped them with coding. They made this fun. Working together made me realize what I had been missing. I couldn’t create or achieve on my own; I needed the help of friends.</p>
                        <p>The big day finally arrived. It’s time to reveal the capability of our robot that we put tremendous effort into for the past few months. I approached the front of the class (fly zipped, of course) and we delivered an exciting presentation about our work. I felt no more fear nor discomfort. As I was presenting, I dived into my memory and rewinded to the very start. How much have I changed? I’m gradually seeing the errors of my timidness, and I’m trying to learn to be more open. In a room full of people, I feel comfortable. Now, as I stand in front of these curious people, sharing our stories, my grin has never grown so wide. I left the stage with an ardent applause. Immediately after, we high-fived each other, and yes, I had a banana, of which the peel was properly placed in the trash bin.</p>

                        <p>Standing out there on the field, gazing towards the clear and azure sky, my teacher told me that something unusual and special was about to happen. Suddenly, black shadows enveloped the sky, the sun seemingly disappearing in an instant. Through the protective colored cellophane, I saw our star eroded by the dark plate and, instantly, the rays were blocked.</p>
                        <p>I remember my teacher slowly and patiently explaining what was happening, why it was happening, and how it was happening. As my fellow kindergarten classmates were frolicking and screaming at each other, I stood there in awe.</p>
                        <p>I couldn’t look away.</p>
                        <p>The movement of planets, the influences of gravity, the principle of light… I was bathed in science. I wondered about the questions that we didn’t know the answers to, how life seemed so insignificant in the context of how large the universe is; I marveled at it all.</p>
                        <p>So I devoured any books I could get my hands on to learn more. I wanted to understand.  And even if I couldn’t get the answers, I wanted to be able to ask the questions. I discovered the field of science, and the vastness, and the open-ended questions, and immediately, I set a goal for myself to pursue the unknown domains of astronomy and physics. And I was hooked.</p>
                        <p>I enrolled in AP Physics, and was astonished by the fundamental laws of physics that were established by pioneer scientists, my heroes, which constructed our cognition of our surroundings in the modern world. In AP Calculus, I am obsessed with the rules and equations that solve complicated problems easily, like a hot knife cutting through butter. Like my earlier readings as a child, I devoured this new knowledge, though more questions arose. In these separate fields, I was curious to find their intersection.</p>
                        <p>Diving into the pool of knowledge, I start to see how art, physics, and mathematics complete each other in a beautiful stance, how they solve the deepest questions I had in my childhood. The desire of learning, the passion of discovering, and the boundless curiosity lead me towards college, the sanctuary of acquiring knowledge. Gilded with wisdom, I’m confident that I can become one of those pioneering scientists, enlightening the path in the future for mankind.</p>

                    <div id="body">
                        <p>I’m not a fast runner. My running stride can only be described with one word - awkward. I lack the power and the speed of a sprinter, though I might only have slightly better stamina.   So, naturally, I decided to join the track and field team.</p>
                        <p>We have practices twice a week, but during the weeks leading up to our competitions, the drills become incredibly intense. I run until my feet numbs, until I feel like tearing my lungs apart, until my stomach turns and I rush to the drains. It’s truly difficult, nearly impossible to survive with merely perseverance and the sense of accomplishment. I always wonder how I manage to maintain my spirit with the team under such pressure.</p>
                        <p>But my teammates pick me up. We are a family - a feeling like no other. I love how we take care of each other, just like how we would with our siblings. We laugh. We joke. We chat.  We sprint. We chase. We wear out. We lie on the field. We puke. And we laugh some more. I am inspired by their passion, and I like to believe that my awkward running stride inspires them as well. Whether it’s finishing that last lap, or studying for our next math test together, the warmth and camaraderie of my family, of my community, gives me the energy to push through.  When the drills are finally finished and exhaustion takes over, I always leave the track with a genuine grin. I belong here.</p>

                        <p>“Mr. Jayson, how can I make our mousetrap race car faster?”</p>
                        <p>I was only eleven years old, with curiosity and exhilaration overflowing from my shimmering eyes. Mr. Jayson always reacted with that mild and amiable smile, he was never tired to fulfill my desire of acquiring knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Ever since, his laboratory became my favorite secret base to hang out in. I’ll work on my project, enhancing my mousetrap racer, and ask whenever questions pop into my mind. Every single time my confusions are solved, the dead knots in my mind unties; my brain feels like a dog, finally unleashed, bolting into the wilderness and breathing the air of freedom. I enjoy the feeling of learning something new, learning something unique, learning something I never thought of before. Every single question I ask feels like I’m gaining experience - like an upgrade of my knowledge, which enlightens me, keeping my mind fresh and clear, giving me the opportunity to apply them to future challenges.</p>
                        <p>It’s my natural instinct to find out the principles behind concepts. When all my classmates were slumbering in their sweet dreams, I hopped towards Mr. Jayson’s laboratory like a cat, eager to learn more. ...But wait, didn’t curiosity kill the cat? I hopped towards Mr. Jayson’s laboratory like a leveret, who is extraordinarily curious about everything around it, eager to set off on an adventure and explore the unknown. (That’s better.)</p>
                        <p><i>Asking</i> questions became a significant part of my life. There are so many unknowns, just waiting for me to discover.  Asking is really the only way to satisfy the curious fraction of me, to interact with the other part of me, to fulfill the missing half of me, attaining my desire to learn, both academically and socially.</p>

                        <p>He was pouting with anger. I could feel a slight sorrow hidden beneath his emotions as I tried to calm him down. Quarrels between siblings are normal, and today we argued about fairness.</p>
                        <p>I sometimes take my brother around the city on the weekends, traveling through busy traffic on a wobbly bus. I use this time to catch up, but as we talk, he mentions how he thinks it’s unfair that my parents offer me everything first, while he receives hand-me downs. As I attempt to calm and make peace, I reflect. As the elder forerunner among us siblings, standing as a role model is a duty.</p>
                        <p>We hopped off the bus and grabbed a pack of his favorite wheel cake. Sitting on a bench among the hustling market, I shared with him my experiences of dealing with problems and obstacles in school and how to overcome the challenges that we’ll potentially encounter. Going through these difficulties firsthand, I felt it was my duty to guide my brother with love and advice.</p>
                        <p>He took another bite of that alluring snack, the sweet red bean paste tickled his taste buds, bringing a bundle of sorrow away. I wanted to make him feel loved, feel significant, feel that I cared about him more than anyone else does. This was how I learned to be a brother, a leader among the siblings, a leader among my peers. Sharing my most genuine advice, leading them out of the maze in their minds - I want to let them know, let my brother know, that I’m always there for them, for him.</p>
                        <p>My brother slowly finished the wheel cake that was held between his palms, as if he’s not only consuming the snack, but also digesting my words and care at the same time. I define leadership by how I treat others, and I’m mindful of how my actions and words may influence them. I turned my head towards my brother and shifted my eyes over his cheeks. That smile gradually appeared, and I felt content. It was as sweet as that wheel cake.</p>

                        <p>Bang! The sound of the gunshot ripped through the air. Echoes like thunder raced over the track, upon the stadium, and into the clouds, resonating with my pounding heart. As I ran, I peered at my opponent on my left, with a muscular build and long stride, overtake me. To my right, similar athletic competitors breezed past with ease. Without panicking, I steadily followed at my own pace and adjusted my breath to a smooth pattern. <i>Just be myself</i>, I thought.</p>
                        <p>We have track practices twice a week, but leading up to competitions, the drills become incredibly intense. Everyone on my team looks like a runner: stiff calf muscles, sleek abs, rock solid quads, and lengthy. As I step onto the scale and look into the mirror, I see an exception - the pale, fragile kid, staring back at me.</p>
                        <p>But I tried; I tried to keep up with them, to make myself at least a part of the team. I had to work twice as hard just to catch up, and when I got there, the team left me in the dust (figuratively and literally). So I worked harder. But along the way, I realized something important. Some traits are just gifted to certain people, while others need to work hard at it. Though my efforts made me feel disappointed, why bother taking it so seriously?</p>
                        <p><i>Let’s Go!</i>, my coach yelled. Back at my competition, and I’m starting to fade behind. As the Hulks sprint past me, I keep my slender legs moving at a constant speed, putting one foot over the other. I don’t give up. I don’t back down. I keep going. Hulks next to me? That’s OK, I’ll just be me. As I approach the finish line, I let out a triumphant sigh; when life gives you lemons, just throw them away and buy yourself some tangerines.</p>
