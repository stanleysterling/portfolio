                    <p>So many people have left this world in the year 2020, these ones we respect, the ones we admire, and the ones we love. Some passed away silently and peacefully, without leaving and words or spirits. while the others burned the last fuels of their life, bringing illumination and positivity to the world. Death is inevitable, but we are the ones who decide how our lives end, and how our lives bring influences to the world.</p>
                    <p>Though death cannot be avoided, it can be challenged. We should not let our lives fade away with nothing, instead we should fight back against our withering lives and thrive for the very last moment, bringing the energies up and witness the power of life, as we know that there won't ever be a next-time.</p>
                    <p>Those <i>wise men</i> who went through a life that had no recognition or glory and did not make much of an impression, they understand that death is inevitable. These man might have regrets about how they lived their lives, they still fight against death with any chance, perhaps because they desire for more time to make an impact on the societies that they have failed to do so in their lifespan.</p>
                    <p>Those <i>good men</i> who see their last moments of their lives pass by like a final wave, mourn the fact that they weren't able to accomplish more. They are always unsatisfied with their accomplishments, striving endlessly to make their mark on the world. They won't stop resisting death until the day they can't physically hold it anymore.</p>
                    <p>Those <i>wild men</i> who have lived in the moment and embraced life to the fullest, enjoying the carefree life for the entire time, never realize that the joy is silently leaving them behind until the very last moment. By the time they discover the reality, the inevitable death is already right in front of sight. These people refuse to peacefully accept death at any cost.</p>
                    <p>Those <i>grave men</i> who are about to pass away, will suddenly realize in clarity that even those who have lost their eyesights can still, be full of illumination and joy. These people who are soon fading, will then resist death, since they find out that they haven't fulfilled their lives when those with disadvantages have already accomplished things that were seemed impossible.</p>
                    <p>Most people at the very last moments of their lives choose to challenge death and make sure that they exhibit their values to the world for one last time. No people should try to face death peacefully and passively. We want to be the ones remembered by the community and history, be the ones whose spirits live long in the world and thrive prosperously.</p>
                    <h2>"Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light."</h2>
                    <p>Condolences to those who lost their lives in 2020, Chadwick Boseman, Grant Imahara, Naya Rivera, the eight hundred and sixty thousand and sixty thousand individuals who perished of COVID-19, and a lot more.</p>
